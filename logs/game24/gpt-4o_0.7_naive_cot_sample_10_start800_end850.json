Multiply 2 and 10 to get 20 (remaining numbers are 7, 20).\n   \\[\n   2 * 10 = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. Add 20 and 4 to get 24 (remaining number is 24).\n   \\[\n   20 + 4 = 24\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\\[\n(9 + 1) * 2 + 4 = 24\n\\]\n\nThis was incorrect, trying again:\n\n1. Add 9 and 2 to get 11 (remaining numbers are 1, 7, 11).\n   \\[\n   9 + 2 = 11\n   \\]\n\n2. Add 11 and 1 to get 12 (remaining numbers are 7, 12).\n   \\[\n   11 + 1 = 12\n   \\]\n\n3. Multiply 12 by 2 to get 24 (remaining number is 24).\n   \\[\n   12 * 2 = 24\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\\[\n(9 + 2) * (1 + 7) = 24\n\\]",
